# Super-League-API
Workplace for BAE API project

This API is used to create, read, update, and delete entries into a database. The entries are Football Clubs. 
The fields required to successfully add a football club include the Club name, it's nationality, and the number of 
domestic titles won, simply put ClubTitles.

The user can get the names of the clubs in the database to see if they should be there.
For instance, if they believe a club does not have the credentials to be in the list, based on their titles won, they can be removed.
The user can also create clubs of their own and fill out the details as they please.

The testing of the application can be done in in Post Man. The user can test for each request by using localhost:8080 as the url
and performing different get requests. Alternatively, with the front end page, users can use buttons to interact with the list to test 
what clubs come back. For instance, the user can request clubs from specific nationalities, and the application will return those clubs.
